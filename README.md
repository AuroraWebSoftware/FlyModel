### Creating and Using Fly Models

With FlyModel, you can dynamically create models and perform various operations. Hereâ€™s how:

Instantiate a Model with a Deck

```php
$building = FlyModel::of('building');
```

Save the Model if not saved or created before

```php
$building->save();
```

Perform Field Operations
```php
$building->flexy->name = 'Headquarter Building'
$building->flexy->address = 'Ali Pasha Ave. number 10';
$building->flexy->city = 'Ä°stanbul';
$building->flexy->floor = 7;
$building->flexy->area = 313;
$building->flexy->active = true;

$building->save();
```


Perform Eloquent Operations

```php
$buildings = FlyModel::of('building')->all();

$istanbulBuildings = FlyModel::of('building')
                        ->where('flexy_city', 'Ä°stanbul')
                        ->get();

$largeBuildings = FlyModel::of('building')
                    ->where('flexy_area', '>' 500)
                    ->orderBy('flexy_area')
                    ->get();
                    
$highBuildingsInIstanbul = FlyModel::of('building')
                            ->where('flexy_floor', '>' 10)
                            ->where('flexy_city', 'Ä°stanbul')
                            ->get();
